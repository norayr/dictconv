Dictconv
----------

Dictconv is a small program to convert a dictionay file type in another dictionary file type.

Thanks to Karl Grill (for the reverse engineering) and Ricardo Villalba (from Wordtrans), the Babylon glossaries are supported.

The installation process is trivial:

$ ./configure --help
$ ./configure [options]
$ make all install

The usage is very simple:

$ dictconv -o target_file.ext original_file.ext

The program detects the type of dictionary by its extension:

.bgl for Babylon glossaries
.dct for Sdictionary dictionaries.
.dic for plain text dictionaries
.ifo for StarDict dictionaries
.index for DICT dictionaries
.tei for Freedict dictionaries (XML format)

Currently, it supports converting from Babylon glossaries, Freedict dictionaries, Sdictionary dictionaries and Stardict dictionaries to DICT dictionaries, plain text dictionaries and StarDict dictionaries. More file types will be added in new versions.
When converting to StarDict and DICT, the .dict file is not compressed. This feature will be added in future. If you want to compress this file, use dictzip program:

$ dictzip target_file.dict

The program is in early development stage. So, you will find bugs. If you find a bug, please report to rgfbr@yahoo.com.br.
